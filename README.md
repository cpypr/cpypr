# 👋 Hi there, I am Cris

With 15+ years of experience, I learned PHP, JavaScript, and CSS "the hard way" by evolving alongside the web from its foundational roots to modern frameworks.

While my career has been defined by these core technologies, I am currently expanding my toolkit by learning Ruby, a language whose elegant syntax and human-centric philosophy feel like a true homecoming. 

Beyond the code, I believe that expertise is most valuable when it is shared. I find fulfillment in mentoring others, as teaching deepens my own understanding and helps us grow together.


## what am I up to?

- deep diving into the Ruby language
- building my own space in Ruby on Rails
