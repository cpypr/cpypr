# 👋 Hi there, I am Cris

    A little bit more about me
  </summary>
  
##  
  
With 15+ years of experience, I learned PHP, JavaScript, and CSS "the hard way" by evolving alongside the web from its foundational roots to modern frameworks.

While my career has been defined by these core technologies, I am currently expanding my toolkit by learning Ruby, a language whose elegant syntax and human-centric philosophy feel like a true homecoming. 

Beyond the code, I believe that expertise is most valuable when it is shared. I find fulfillment in mentoring others, as teaching deepens my own understanding and helps us grow together.

## Currently diving deep into:
- Mastering Ruby
- Building my own space in Rails
- Writing clean, testable code (TDD)

Always exploring new ways to solve problems and open to contribute to the open-source community
